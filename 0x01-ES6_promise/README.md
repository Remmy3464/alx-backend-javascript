# JavaScript ES6 Promises

This project is a simple implementation of ES6 Promises in JavaScript. Promises are a pattern for handling asynchronous operations, allowing you to write cleaner and more maintainable code.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download the latest version from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone this repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

## git clone https://github.com/Beinglegendary/javascript-es6-promises.git
cd javascript-es6-promises
npm install.

## Usage

To use the Promises in this project, you can require the `Promise` object and create a new instance using the `new` keyword:

```javascript
const Promise = require('./promise');

const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // asynchronous operation goes here
  if (operationSuccessful) {
    resolve(value);
  } else {
    reject(error);
  }
});
