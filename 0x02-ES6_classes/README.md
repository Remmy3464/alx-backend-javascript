# Introduction to JavaScript ES6 Classes
JavaScript ES6 introduced a new way to define object-oriented classes using the class keyword. This syntax is similar to other object-oriented languages, such as Java or C#, and makes it easier for developers familiar with those languages to write object-oriented code in JavaScript.

Defining a Class
To define a class in JavaScript ES6, you can use the class keyword followed by the name of the class. The class definition is enclosed in curly braces, and the body of the class contains the methods and properties of the class.

Here is an example of a simple class definition:
``` class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}```

JavaScript ES6 introduced a new way to define object-oriented classes using the class keyword. This syntax is similar to other object-oriented languages, such as Java or C#, and makes it easier for developers familiar with those languages to write object-oriented code in JavaScript.

## Defining a Class
To define a class in JavaScript ES6, you can use the class keyword followed by the name of the class. The class definition is enclosed in curly braces, and the body of the class contains the methods and properties of the class.

Here is an example of a simple class definition:


```class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }```

  ```sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}```

The constructor method is a special method that is called when an instance of the class is created. It is used to initialize the properties of the object. In the example above, the constructor method takes two arguments: name and age, which are used to initialize the name and age properties of the object.
The sayHello method is a simple method that logs a greeting to the console.

## Creating an instance of a class
To create an instance of a class, you can use the new keyword followed by the name of the class. For example:
``` const person = new Person("John", 30);```

This creates a new instance of the Person class and assigns it to the person variable.
## Accessing properties and methods
Once you have an instance of a class, you can access its properties and methods using the dot notation. For example:
```console.log(person.name); // Outputs "John"
person.sayHello(); // Outputs "Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old."```

## Extending a class
You can also create a new class that extends an existing class using the extends keyword. The new class will inherit all of the methods and properties of the parent class, and you can also add additional methods and properties.
Here is an example of a class that extends the Person class defined earlier:
``` class Student extends Person {
  constructor(name, age, major) {
    super(name, age);
    this.major = major;
  }```

  ```sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am studying ${this.major}.`);
  }
}```

The Student class has a constructor method that calls the constructor method of the parent class using the super keyword. It also has its own sayHello method that overrides the sayHello method of the parent class.
To create an instance of the Student class, you can use the same syntax as before:
```const student = new Student("Jane", 20, "Computer Science");```
